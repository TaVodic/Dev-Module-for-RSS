	All connections are intended to be point-to-point connections on PCBs. Typically these
	connections can be treated as electrically short paths and transmission line reflections
	can be safely ignored. Neither a connector nor a characteristic impedance for electrically long PCB traces is within the scope of this specification. http://ebook.pldworld.com/_eBook/-Telecommunications,Networks-/TCPIP/RMII/rmii_rev12.pdf

Single-ended: an isolated trace that just carries a digital signal or RF signal
Differential traces: two traces that are driven together with equal and opposite polarity
Non-coplanar: a trace configuration where there is no additional copper on the same layer as the trace being routed
Coplanar: a trace configuration where grounded copper pour is included on the same layer as the trace
