ETH conn RJ45
	chassis Ground plane around RJ45 ???

MDI - Twisted pair
	Traces between PHY device, transformer and RJ45 connector should be
	designed with a differential impedance of 100Ω±10% and with an
	impedance of 50Ω related to GND.
	differentiál impedance 100ohm

	Calculated - W:0.15 S:0.15 - Zdiff:100ohm

vias can be inside PAD
fencing vias - via okolo plošáku
