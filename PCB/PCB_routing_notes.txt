	All connections are intended to be point-to-point connections on PCBs. Typically these
	connections can be treated as electrically short paths and transmission line reflections
	can be safely ignored. Neither a connector nor a characteristic impedance for electrically long PCB traces is within the scope of this specification. http://ebook.pldworld.com/_eBook/-Telecommunications,Networks-/TCPIP/RMII/rmii_rev12.

MDI - Twisted pair
	Traces between PHY device, transformer and RJ45 connector should be
	designed with a differential impedance of 100Ω±10% and with an
	impedance of 50Ω related to GND.
